Self Crique: 
This project was a great experience in learning to utilize github for team projects and how to communicate and plan a web design in a group. The class focus on the theory behind certain standards and techniques and how to implement them helped me with learning to not just make a website but also make it appealing to a user and convienient for them. I could definitely use more practice and feedback on creating an appealing site through color choice and especially with whitespace placement and layout. Overall, I believe I'm made significant improvement in my abilities to design an attractive website through this class.
